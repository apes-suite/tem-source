title: Requirements

Below are the most important requirements for getting, compiling and running 
solvers developed with the TreElm framework.

Compilation 
-----------
- [Mercurial](http://www.mercurial.selenic.com): Getting sources 
- [Python](http://www.python.org): the build tool waf relies on python and most of
          the scripts inside the package are written with Python 
- Compiler: the vast source files are written in Fortran 95/2003. 
           We recommend [GNU Gfortran 5.0+](http://gcc.gnu.org/wiki/GFortran)
           and [Intel 12.1+](http://software.intel.com/en-us/articles/intel-compilers/)
- MPI 2.0 enabled environment
          We recommend [OpenMPI 1.5+](http://www.open-mpi.org/)

Post-Processing and Visualization
---------------------------------
- [Gnuplot](http://www.gnuplot.info/)
- [Paraview](http://www.paraview.org/)
